    "<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Our dataset comes from the <a href='https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings'>Washington Post</a>, who, <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/'>starting in 2015</a>, began to track comprehensive data on every fatal shooting by a police officer in the United States. The majority of data in this set was compiled from news stories, social media, and official police reports. The dataset currently has 5862 samples/rows (as of 12/07/2020). Unfortunately, this number increases every week. Our target variable is a boolean class representing if a body camera was used during the shooting. Our features are date, manner of death, if the victim was armed, victim’s age, race, and gender, the state where it occurred, whether the victim exhibited signs of mental illness, whether the victim attempted to flee, as well as the latitude and longitude of the incident.</p> \n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-indent: 2em;'>Additionally, the dataset contains columns which we will exclude: id, name, city of incident, threat level, and is_geocoding_exact. We deemed the threat level column as described on the github page to be too vague to draw conclusions from because its values of \"attack\", \"other\", and \"undetermined\" each may include incidences where an officer was threatened. The ID column is simply a unique number for each incident and thus does not play any role in the incident. The city value is too specific to be meaningfully represented in a numeric fashion. The is_geocoding_exact column is simply a boolan variable which tells if the longitude and latitude columns are exact. As of the time of this writing, only 8 samples are false, so we simply filter these samples out and otherwise ignore the column. Finally, because names are personally identifiable, we believed it would be unethical to use them as a feature in this project. As such, each of these five columns will be ignored.</p>\n",

    "<p style='text-indent: 2em'>Our outcome variable is body_camera and our feature variables are date, manner_of-death, armed, age, gender, race, state, signs_of_mental_illness, flee, longitude, and  latitude. The independent variable for each of our hypotheses is our outcome variable, body_camera, and the dependent variables are our feature variables listed above. Date will be an important predictor because if bodycam use has increased over time, then there should be a strong, positive correlation between date and a positive bodycam classification. If any of the other features are determined to be important, it could indicate bias within the police system. As officers are always supposed to have bodycameras on, if any features could be used to predict a lack of bodycam use, it indicates actively choosing not to use a bodycam. We anticipate features such as age, gender, race, and possibly state as being especially significant.<p>\n",
    "<p style='text-indent: 2em'>This is a supervised machine learning task, specifically Binary Classification, because we have a set of feature variables which are using to predict a known target variable. This target variable has a limited domain of True or False. For this task, we plan to compare the effectiveness of a neighbors-based classifier against a linear classifier on our dataset. We will use the KNearestNeighbors classifer to represent a neighbors algorithm. LinearRegression will serve as a baseline for linear classifiers, as it scales well to high dimensional data. Additionally, we will use the LASSO and RidgeRegression linear models. Ridge works better with high dimensional data when many of the variables are important, which would perform better if our features correlate strongly with a positive bodycam classification. LASSO works better for datasets with fewer important features, which would perform better if the features are not strongly correlated. By using both of our algorithms in this way, we can gain a deeper insight into our data.</p>"

Beacuse of this, we feel the data would better represented as a simpler boolean. Armed will be marked True only if the victim is listed as anything other than \"unarmed\" or \"undetermined\". While this groups together any item the victim was \"armed\" with in an overly simplistic way (e.g. \"pen\" and \"gun\" will both result in a True armed value), contextually speaking, the most important consideration is that the officer saw the victim as armed."

    "<p style='text-indent: 2em'>In this project we compared the sklearn implementation of k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to two linear algorithms on our dataset. These linear algorithms were the RidgeClassifier and Linear State Vector Machine Classifier, or LinearSVC in sklearn. Across all sets and regardless of hyperparameter tuning, the KNN classifier revealed the best and most consistent performance. This answers our initial question, showing that a neighbors-based classifier would perform better than a linear algorithm for this dataset. Based on these findings, KNN is the algorithm which should be used for this predictive model. However, despite being the most accurate, KNN was still only slightly more accurate than a blind guess (50%). This implies that the features in our dataset cannot accurately predict whether an officer was using a bodycamera in a given police shooting instance, answering our primary research question. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-indent'>We were unable to reject the null hypothesis in any of our hypothesis tests, with two exceptions. Our tests showed a significant difference in police bodycamera usage with only White and Black victims, the two largest race groups in the set. This means, in general, victim demographics do not seem to correlate with whether an officer was using a bodycamera. This reinforces the answer to our research question that these features are not accurate predictors of police bodycamera usage.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-indent'>Our findings in this project seem to be a positive from a societal perspective. This shows that there are no obvious trends in victim demographics contributing to unequal bodycamera usage. However, bodycameras are not yet as widespread as many agree they should be. This is evidenced by our choropleth in <b>Section 3.2</b>, which shows that even the state with the highest usage of bodycameras, Vermont, only saw a 50% use in this dataset as of December 11, 2020. In the future, there is room for deeper investigation into which parts of the country are leading or trailing in terms of bodycamera usage. Additionally, there may be many factors which influence the adoption rate of bodycameras in an area (e.g. wealth, size of police department, crime rate, etc.) which may warrant other investigation. Finally, it is important for bodycamera usage to be reported; at the time of writing, this Washington Post dataset appeared to be the only readily available dataset which contained comprehensive information about bodycamera usage spanning the entire United States. Even so, many states were underrepresented in this dataset. In all, though this report sheds an important light on the usage of bodycameras with United States police officers, there is still a lot of work waiting to be done.\n",
